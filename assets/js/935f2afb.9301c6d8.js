However, that might be confusing if you don\'t have a versioning mechanism in place. Imagine that you wrote a new test for the version v0.5.0 of your application. After some months, your application is in version v0.13.7. Most likely, your tests changed as you moved your application forward. But without versioning, if you revisit that first test you created, it will look like exactly the one you use today instead of the test you originally wrote. That happens because while you have multiple versions of your application, you only keep track of one version of your tests: the current version. So there is no way to go back in time and see what a test looked like in the past.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/what-is-trace-based-testing":{"id":"concepts/what-is-trace-based-testing","title":"What is Trace-Based Testing","description":"Trace-Based Testing is a means of conducting deep integration or system tests by utilizing the rich data contained in a distributed system trace.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"concepts/what-is-tracing":{"id":"concepts/what-is-tracing","title":"what-is-tracing","description":""},"configuration/analytics":{"id":"configuration/analytics","title":"Analytics Settings","description":"To improve the end user experience and to help determine where to focus team resources to improve the tool, Tracetest collects analytics and telemetry information from the system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/config-file-reference":{"id":"configuration/config-file-reference","title":"config-file-reference","description":""},"configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray":{"id":"configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/awsxray","title":"AWS X-Ray","description":"If you want to use AWS X-Ray as the trace data store, you can use the native connection from Tracetest to pull telemetry data directly from any region.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/datadog":{"id":"configuration/connecting-to-data-stores/datadog","title":"Datadog","description":"If you want to use Datadog as the trace data store, you\'ll configure the OpenTelemetry Collector to receive traces from your system and then send them to both Tracetest and Datadog.
